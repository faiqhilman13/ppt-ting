Differentiating efforts of players
Description
Key takeaway
Telco-led mobile wallet

Mobile payment solutions that are available (app-form) to customers upon sign up with a telco company. The mobile wallet allows for C2B and P2P transactions

![Related image](GoogleShape464p31.jpg)

![https://www.dash.com.sg/wp-content/themes/singtel-dash-microsite/assets/images/logo.png](GoogleShape463p31.jpg)
Customer experience is compromised as players try to diversify and differentiate themselves
Customers often have to take additional steps to redeem points/benefits (troublesome)
Interoperability is still lacking as payment products are limited to app users and payments are restricted to in-app and pre-approved merchants
Lack of KYC and risk management measures on customers result in defaults and bad debts – business model become unsustainable

Network co-brand cards
Co-branded cards are collaborative efforts by a card network and a retailer to provide additional incentives to customers, usually aimed to drive shared customer loyalty

Disruptors enter the payments landscape with intentions to maximise customer wallet-use to support core business. Discounts and incentives are offered frequently to consumers

Buy-now-pay-later services

Players are providing a buy-now pay-later service that allows customers to make a purchase and pay in instalments, assisting customers with lower cash-in-hand

![Image result for zippay](GoogleShape475p31.jpg)

Reduction in costs to users

Players are expected to reduce MDR in order to remain competitive and encourage merchant adoption (e.g. AMEX have reduced MDR for some merchants to 0.8% per transaction from 4.5%

Cashless adoption can be facilitated by breaking the cash cycle simultaneously, lowering overall funds in circulation
Chun Kit receives funds directly into his mobile wallet without needing a physical ATM withdrawal
Funds are disbursed digitally into Soo Keng, Marc, and Maria’s e-wallets respectively

Key Takeaways
NewCo will be competing in the informal cash market in its initial phase – capture rate is driven by NewCo’s interoperability feature and it’s position at top-of-the-wallet
NewCo will capture debit card transactions subsequently as consumers move away from delayed to instant settlement of funds
Credit and charge card transactions will not be captured by NewCo as they offer consumers a different product proposition to NewCo, competing in a different market
Key Takeaways
As a national infrastructure, NewCo’s fees to service users will be lower than local and international ePayment players – main revenue lines include the wallet, scheme and membership fee
NewCo Wallet will be in direct competition with Google, Samsung and Apple wallet at steady state
NewCo’s costs buckets are categorised into Plan, Build, Engage, Operate and Change – largest in Build as capital is required develop the scheme infrastructure and directory required to enable interoperability

![](GoogleShape1014p44.jpg)
Key Takeaways
A hybrid (cross) model of a Business Unit-led and Functions-led operating model is recommended for NewCo as support services are centralized and redundancies are avoided
NewCo’s target operating model is aimed to be lean and equipped with essential “run” function for NewCo’s service offering, “change” function for products and innovation , and “enable” function for product technology management and enterprise functions
Key Takeaways
NewCo is recommended to be a private company as it allows for independence, swift changes without ministerial approvals, and limited risks for NewCo
As a public infrastructure, NewCo’s Board of Directors will include a chairman, executive directors, shareholder representatives and independent board members from various backgrounds to uphold unbiased decision making

Key Takeaways
NewCo services to include capturing payment request, transmitting messages, and verifying and authorising transactions to facilitating clearing and settlement
To capture payment requests, NewCo will leverage on existing channels (i.e. QR code) and greenfield (i.e. biometrics) in order to maximise affordability, availability, scalability and security
NewCo will provide a seamless payments experience which includes human-to-system and system-to-system interaction
Key Takeaways
As a public infrastructure, an integrated go-live model was recommended for NewCo as stakeholder socialisation and testing runs in parallel with the traditional plan, build and run
Go-live for NewCo will be fast-to-market, potentially ahead of emerging FinTech competition
Flexibility in making operational refinements
Support from key stakeholders in the early stages is crucial to ensure the success of NewCo
